## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-is a method of software development that uses software components called 
services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability,
and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-it supports loose coupling everywhere in the project.
this means that it support the two or more processes or function 
that are not dependent on each other this helps the design model to be more
flexible

-SOA supports interoperability
this means that it support the interoparability or it can communicate
to the other processes to be able to exchange the information and to use it
this is like a giving and taking situation

-It increases the quality of service
this increase the quality of service because we can mapped the processes
or function in the design model and also we can build the project faster
this increase the services because the processes/service are communicating with each other

-It supports vendor diversity
it can support any other system in the market that can help them to
maximize their processes and help their systems on overall function/processes/service

-It promotes discovery and federation.
this search the services with the help of SOA. also this promotes Federation
by following the standard in organization and you can use other things in 
your older system to your new system.

-It is still maturing and achievable idea
this kind of medthod services are still maturing and achievable idea
that helps other business application to attain their needs in their processes and 
services

3. Define Microservices.
-a architectural and organizational approach to software development
where software is composed of small independent services
that communicate over well-defined APIs.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Flexibility
the benifits are flexibility it helps the user by using the microservices
they can customize and lessen the specific needs of processes

-Data Security
the information security/data security is Improve why? because
the process/service since it is independent the impormation or
data are break to other services that cause the system to 
protect it from unauthorize attacker

-Scalable Development
since it is independent on the processes it lessen the fault when
changing the processes or upgrading it with out affecting other 
processes/module.

-Effective migration and upgrade
by the use of microservices people can migrade easily and upgrade
because of the microservices it is supported by new things
in the industry

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-Services
the similarities are they talk on how we are going to do or map our processes
and it have different technique but they are similar in a way that they
help function,processes,services to improve

Differences
-Dependent & Independent
the soa is dependent in the services/module/process and the microservices are independent
-Reuseability
the soa is that you cannnot use the services/module/process again you need to make another one

-Implementation
to implement the soa it becomes depended to service and microservices are independent.
soa is dependent are shared resources with other service and the microservices are independent

additional the microservices are the soa upgraded version and other people say that the microservices are
better
